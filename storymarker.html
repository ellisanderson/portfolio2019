      <h2>Trial / Trail 1</h2>
      <p>For this project, I was interested in exploring how multiple people might contribute their voice to a designed thing. One potential implication pointed to inclusivity on a grander scale, representing the contextual experience of each individual. In order to be truly inclusive, I hypothesized that the designed thing would need to be malleable, shifting according to the individual who engaged with the system.</p>
      <p>Inspired by current events surrounding the removal of confederate monuments, I chose to focus my attention towards memorials, landmarks and historical plaques. This led me to the works of Kevin Lynch and NC State University's own Scott Townsend, whose design research deals with alternative mappings, hegemonic relationships of power and contextual insight into the lived experiences of different communities around the world. Attempting to synthesize this information, I envisioned a modular placard, something that would be installed in a public space to reflect changes in the community. Guidelines were established in order to preserve previous messages as new messages developed over time.</p>

      <h2>Trial / Trail 2</h2>
      <p>Returning to the drawing board, I aimed to further specify my problem area and make stronger connections to the ideas I was looking at in order to shape my designs. I continued to research, clarifying some of the differences between landmarks, monuments, memorials, places and points of interest. Out of this came the idea of “graded membership,” a spectrum between common understanding and personal association of locations as landmarks.</p>

      <p>Narrowing my problem space, I chose to design for sites of political protest. The second trial/trail revolved around the idea of a mobile application that would allow participants to archive their experiences within a protest via a geo-specific marker, as a way to extend the temporary lifespan of these communal events. Participants would create a collection of monuments (a node) in the virtual reality space by contributing their own perspectives during the event. These markers would be aggregated, mapped, viewable and/or interacted with by future participants in proximity to their location.</p>

      <p>There was concern, however, regarding the representation of each voice within the system. From the feedback I received, the question became: how are people depicted beyond a pin and a message? While the trail/trial focused on a specific group of people and cause, it was difficult for others to understand the relevance and implications this concept had for design practices.</p>
